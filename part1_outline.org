#+TITLE: Part1 Outline

* Methods
** Datapoints
Where, licsense, How much,

** Feature selection
*** DONE Data analysis and vis -> unbalanced!!!!
- Check for missing data
  - 5 poitn summary
    -df.describe()
    - look for the means
      -> big diff-> mean it
df.hist()

*** TODO Correlation heatmap
.heatmap(X.corr(), annot= True, mask = mask, vmin= -1, vmax= 1)

*** TODO VIF analysis

*** TODO Text for unbalcing
*** TODO Text for heatmap
*** TODO Text for vif analysis


** ML model
*** TODO Explain why this model
*** TODO Explain why this loss function
- hypothesis spaces?
- linear predictor

** Loss function
*** TODO Loss function
*** TODO Explain why this loss function

** Model validation
*** TODO Splitting data
*** TODO Explain why this splitting method



* TODOS
** Problem Formulation
*** DONE Formulate the problem

*** DONE Data points must be explicitly explained
*** DONE Dataset must be multidimensional

*** DONE Explain where data is from
*** DONE Explain the type of data

*** DONE Explain the typ of ml (un or supervised)
-> explain labels if supervised

** Methods

*** DONE state number of datapoints and the processing

*** DONE explain feature selection/engineering(processing)

*** TODO state the model (hypothesis space)
*** TODO explain choice of model (see ml book)

*** TODO state loss function
*** TODO explain choice of loss function? (see ml book)

*** TODO explain process of model validation
*** TODO explain the split of data in training/validation
*** TODO state the size of the sets
*** TODO explain these choices


* TODOs
Which method to use?
Explain why this model
Which loss function
Explain why this function
How to split data in training/validation





** Miscellaneous
*** TODO Code
*** TODO Quality of writing
*** TODO Sources no plagiarism
